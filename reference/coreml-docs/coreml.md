Integrate machine learning models into your app.

## Overview

Use [Core ML](coreml.md) to integrate machine learning models into your app. [Core ML](coreml.md) provides a unified representation for all models. Your app uses [Core ML](coreml.md) APIs and user data to make predictions, and to train or fine-tune models, all on a person’s device.

Next, in the center is the Core ML framework icon, and on the right is a generic app icon, labeled “your app”.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/ae17ffa70ecbce075dc4b57539ec6dde/media-3901331%402x.png)

A model is the result of applying a machine learning algorithm to a set of training data. You use a model to make predictions based on new input data. Models can accomplish a wide variety of tasks that would be difficult or impractical to write in code. For example, you can train a model to categorize photos, or detect specific objects within a photo directly from its pixels.

You build and train a model with the [Create ML app](https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/create-ml/) bundled with Xcode. Models trained using [Create ML](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/CreateML) are in the [Core ML](coreml.md) model format and are ready to use in your app. Alternatively, you can use a wide variety of other machine learning libraries and then use [Core ML Tools](https://coremltools.readme.io) to convert the model into the [Core ML](coreml.md) format. Once a model is on a person’s device, you can use [Core ML](coreml.md) to retrain or fine-tune it on-device, with that person’s data.

[Core ML](coreml.md) optimizes on-device performance by leveraging the CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine while minimizing its memory footprint and power consumption. Running a model strictly on a person’s device removes any need for a network connection, which helps keep a person’s data private and your app responsive.

The framework is the foundation for domain-specific frameworks and functionality. It supports [Vision](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Vision) for analyzing images, [Natural Language](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/NaturalLanguage) for processing text, [Speech](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Speech) for converting audio to text, and [Sound Analysis](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SoundAnalysis) for identifying sounds in audio. [Core ML](coreml.md) itself builds on top of low-level primitives like [Accelerate](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Accelerate) and [BNNS](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Accelerate/bnns-library), as well as [Metal Performance Shaders](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/MetalPerformanceShaders).
