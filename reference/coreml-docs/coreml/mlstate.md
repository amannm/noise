Handle to the state buffers.

## Declaration

**Platforms:** iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS

```objc
class MLState
```

## Overview

A stateful model maintains a state from one prediction to another by storing the information in the state buffers. To use such a model, the client must request the model to create state buffers and get `MLState` object, which is the handle to those buffers. Then, at the prediction time, pass the `MLState` object in one of the stateful prediction functions.

```swift
// Load a stateful model
let modelAsset = try MLModelAsset(url: modelURL)
let model = try await MLModel.load(asset: modelAsset, configuration: MLModelConfiguration())

// Request a state
let state = model.newState()

// Run predictions
for _ in 0 ..< 42 {
  _ = try await model.prediction(from: inputFeatures, using: state)
}

// Access the state buffer.
state.withMultiArray(for: "accumulator") { stateMultiArray in
  ...
}
```

The object is a handle to the state buffers. The client shall not read or write the buffers while a prediction is in-flight.

Each stateful prediction that uses the same `MLState` must be serialized. Otherwise, if two such predictions run concurrently, the behavior is undefined.
