**Platforms:** iOS, iPadOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS

```objc
static func .== (lhs: MLTensor, rhs: MLTensor) -> MLTensor
```

## Overview

A Boolean tensor where each element is true if `self` is equal to than the corresponding element of `other`, and false otherwise.

Shapes must be broadcastable, where the broadcasted shape becomes the shape of the output.
